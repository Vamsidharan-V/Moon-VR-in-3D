The Sun (in Greek: Helios, in Latin: Sol[a]) 
 is the star at the center of the Solar System 
 and is by far the most important source of energy for 
 life on Earth. It is a nearly perfect spherical ball of hot plasma, 
 with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field 
 via a dynamo process. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth,
 and it has a mass about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for 
 about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters  
 of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen; the rest is mostly helium, with much 
 smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon and iron.
