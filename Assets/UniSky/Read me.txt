**Quick start guide**

To add UniSky to your scene and set it up for dynamic weather, simply follow these quick and easy steps:

(1) Drag the UniSky prefab into your "Hierarchy", making sure not to just drag it into the "Scene View".
(2) Set the "Scene Camera" variable under the "General" tab in the UniSky inspector to the main camera of your scene.
(3) Make sure your main camera has a far clip plane that accomodates the sky dome (~100,000 to be safe).
(4) Set your camera's background color is solid black.
(5) Go into the Tag Manager (where you add layers), and name User Layer 8 and User Layer 9 "UniSky - Droplet Effect" and "UniSky - Offscreen Particles", respectively.
(6) In the culling mask of your main camera, remove these two unisky layers defined in step 5.
(7) Add "RainImageEffect.js" to your main camera (it's in the "weather" subfolder), and assign "RainImageEffect.mat" to the "Rain Image Material" slot.
(8) Add "OffscreenParticlesImageEffect.js" to your main camera and assign "OffscreenCompositeMaterial.mat" to the "Composite Material" slot.
(9) Add any existing terrains as a child of the "UniSky" game object in your hierarchy if you want the wind to affect the grass.
(10) Finally, add the "Lightning" prefab as a child to your main camera.
(9) Enjoy!
